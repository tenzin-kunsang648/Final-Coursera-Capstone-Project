596,3032 Grand Ave S,55408,2,4,"This is an up-down duplex close to Lyndale and Lake Street.  

Potential for 5 units on the property:  
the 2 existing two bedroom units, plus the potential for a third attic unit at about 1000 sqft, a fourth basement unit, and there is space for a garage with an apartment.  Neighborhood has approved several others to do these additional units on the block in the last two years. 
Property is also zoned section 5 already if you want to build an apartment building like the neighbor just did - adding value to the property whether you want to do this or not. 

Almost completely renovated In the last 5-10 years:  new kitchens, bathrooms,  boilers, all new plumbing, and new electric.  I have done all the heavy work, but ran out of money for the expansions.   

Rents very easily due to desirable location near uptown and lakes - usually in one day.  Upstairs rents for $1850, downstairs for $2000/mo.  
Upstairs tenants are great and have one more year on lease. Owner occupied downstairs currently.  

Nice balance of easy access to food, fun, and greenspace combined with a quiet street. 
Ideal location near restaurants, wine and cheese shop, bars, and 3 blocks from the  Lyndale-Lake area.  10 blocks to the Minneapolis lakes - just jump on the greenway one block away.  
 
House was listed on Zillow a couple times over the last year as I played around with the idea of selling, but was not actually on the market.  House was under negotiation recently and the deal fell apart so it is back on the market.
